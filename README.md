# Ansible Role: users

[![CI](https://github.com/1000Bulbs/ansible-role-users/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/1000Bulbs/ansible-role-users/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This role manages Linux system users on Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04+). It creates users, sets up their primary and secondary groups, manages home directories and login shells, and supports default or custom configurations.

It handles:

- Validating usernames

- Creating user accounts with optional comments, shells, and home directories

- Managing primary and secondary group membership

- Applying default configuration if specific attributes (e.g., shell, groups) are not provided

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Ansible 2.13+
- Python 3.9+ (for Molecule + testinfra)
- Tested on Ubuntu 22.04+

## üì• Installing the Role

To include this role in your project using a `requirements.yml` file:

```yaml
roles:
  - name: okb.users
    src: git@github.com:1000bulbs/ansible-role-users.git
    scm: git
    version: master
```

Then install it with:

```bash
ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
```

---

## üí° Example Playbook

```yaml
- name: Create system users
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    users_list:
      - username: deploy
        comment: Deployment User

      - username: devops
        comment: DevOps User
        groups:
          - sudo
  roles:
    - role: okb.users
```

---

## üß™ Testing

This role uses a `Makefile` for linting and formatting, and [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with
`pytest-testinfra` for integration testing.

### Run tests locally

#### Lint and Format

```bash
# Run all checks (linting and formatting)
make check

# Run linting tools manually (ruff, yamllint, ansible-lint)
make lint

# Run Python formatting tools manually (ruff)

make format
```

#### Integration Tests

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Molecule integration tests

```bash
molecule test
```

---

## ü™ù Git Hooks

This project includes [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) integration via Git hooks to automatically run formatting and linting checks **before each commit**.

These hooks help catch errors early and keep the codebase consistent across contributors.

### Install Git Hooks

```bash
make install-hooks
```

This will:

- Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
- Register a Git hook in .git/hooks/pre-commit
- Automatically run checks like:
- Code formatting with black and isort
- Linting with ruff, yamllint, and ansible-lint

### Remove Git Hooks

```bash
make uninstall-hooks
```

This removes the Git pre-commit hook and disables automatic checks.

üí° Even with hooks uninstalled, you can still run the same checks manually with `make test`.

Why Use Git Hooks?

- Ensures consistency across contributors
- Catches syntax and style issues before they hit CI
- Prevents accidental commits of broken or misformatted files
- Integrates seamlessly with your local workflow
